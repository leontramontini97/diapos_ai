# Next Steps for DiapsoAI Deployment

## Summary of Progress (5 sentences)
We successfully migrated from a local PostgreSQL setup to Supabase as our backend database and authentication provider. The core payment system was working with Stripe test mode but webhooks required manual simulation due to local development limitations. We consolidated environment variables from multiple `.env` files into a single clean `.env` file  ( alert, the hsell configuration causes lots of bugs locally so we have to cerfuly with preset erronoeous values) and confirmed Supabase database connectivity is working. The application can now query users, payments, and events tables through Supabase's API with proper Row Level Security configured. Our stack is now simplified to Next.js frontend on Vercel + Supabase for database/auth/storage, ready for rapid deployment.

Next, we created supabase authentication component, now user is able to sign up and login, and now we want to tie this session management to the pdf conversion!
## Big Components

### 1. Authentication System
- **Status**: Pending
- **Substeps**:
  - Implement Supabase Auth in Next.js
  - Add login/signup forms
  - Replace email-based user identification with Supabase auth
  - Update API routes to use authenticated users
  - Test authentication flow

### 2. Storage Migration
- **Status**: Pending  
- **Substeps**:
  - Replace AWS S3 with Supabase Storage (nothin tored in s3 yet, so no need for migration)
  - Update file upload components
  - Update environment variables
  - Test file upload/download

### 3. Payment Integration
- **Status**: Partially Complete (needs webhook fixes)
- **Substeps**:
  - Configure production Stripe webhook endpoint 
  - Test credit purchasing flow end-to-end
  - Verify credit assignment to authenticated users
  - Test payment failure scenarios
  - Update webhook URL for production

### 4. Production Deployment
- **Status**: Pending
- **Substeps**:
  - Deploy Next.js app to Vercel
  - Configure production environment variables
  - Set up custom domain
  - Configure Stripe production webhooks
  - Test complete user flow in production

### 5. Core Features Testing
- **Status**: Needs Testing
- **Substeps**:
  - Test lecture upload functionality
  - Verify PDF processing pipeline
  - Test Anki card generationw
  - Validate credit consumption
  - End-to-end user journey testing

## Technical Stack (Current)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (React)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + Supabase
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (to be implemented)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (to be migrated from S3)
- **Payments**: Stripe (test mode working)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

## Environment Status
- ✅ Supabase database connected and working
- ✅ Environment variables consolidated in `.env`
- ✅ Database tables created with RLS policies
- ✅ Basic payment flow functional (manual webhook testing)
- ❌ Authentication not implemented
- ❌ Storage migration not started
- ❌ Production deployment not started

## Immediate Next Actions
1. **Implement Supabase Authentication** - Replace email-only identification
2. **Migrate to Supabase Storage** - Remove AWS S3 dependency  
3. **Deploy to Vercel** - Get production environment running
4. **Configure production webhooks** - Enable real payment processing
5. **End-to-end testing** - Validate complete user journey
